## About AStack

AStack is 100% original with independent technical implementation and architectural design. It takes inspiration from Haystack's API design style but is not based on Haystack code or implementation. AStack has its own independent technical architecture and design philosophy ("everything is a component") with zero adaptation layer design principles.
